<h5>ðŸ“Š The demand for energy is increasing as a result of the growth in both population and 
industrial development. To improve the energy efficiency, consumers need to be more aware 
of their energy consumption. The aim is to provide the consumer and supplier 
an easy way to monitor the energy. </h5>
<h5>ðŸ’¡ This peject can measure the 
energy and send the information to the service provider, who can store this information and
notify the consumer through Web-Application database through internet and SMS.</h5>

<h5>âž¢ The development of an Enhancement of Energy Meter which is having 
capabilities like remote monitoring and controlling of energy meter will lead 
to transparency in the energy meter reading and billing system.</h5>
<h5>âž¢ The proposed system will continuously monitor the energy meter and sends 
data onto a server system of service provider through wireless communication
where data will be stored as well. Also, all the details will be displayed 
continuously on LCD.</h5>
<h5>ðŸ§¿ This system avoids the human intervention in power management. If the
customerexceeds the usage of electricity, the user is informed through SMS 
and Web-Application</h5>
